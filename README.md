# CS-330
Course work from my CS-330 class @ SNHU

1.	**How do I approach designing software?**
      o	**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
      
          The project for this course has taught me a lot. Starting with a simple scene and building off that using modular code was an essential part of successfully completing this project. Another skill that I obtained was problem-solving. This project required a 2D image to be analyzed and created in a 3D scene. This required coming up with the shapes that could be used, applying proper texture, and lighting to create a realistic depiction of said scene. 
          
      o	**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
2.	How do I approach developing programs? 
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me a lot of information about graphics programming and how the code is interpreted to create visualizations in the given scene. This course has given me vital problem-solving skills and a physical application of using mathematics to create objects in a program. I can apply these new-found skills to efficiently problem-solve future assignments and create graphical visualizations when necessary.  
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me a lot about OpenGL and c++. OpenGL could come in handy if a position required a working knowledge of OpenGL. Otherwise, the comfort that I have gained from working in c++ will allow me to progress as a developer and create increasingly more difficult projects as time goes on. This course also taught me the importance of modularizing and testing my code, which will be an essential part of my future career.
